-    <h3 id="gpl">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
-    <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
-
-    <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-        &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
-    <p>
-        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
-
-    <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>
-
-    <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-        software and other kinds of works.</p>
-
-    <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-        to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
-        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-        software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-        any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
-        your programs, too.</p>
-
-    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
-
-    <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
-        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
-
-    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-        freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
-        or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
-        know their rights.</p>
-
-    <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
-
-    <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-        that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
-        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-        authors of previous versions.</p>
-
-    <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-        can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-        protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
-        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
-        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
-
-    <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-        make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
-
-    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-        modification follow.</p>
-
-    <h3><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
-
-    <h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>
-
-    <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
-
-    <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-        works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
-
-    <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-        License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
-        &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
-
-    <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-        exact copy. The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
-        earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>
-
-    <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-        on the Program.</p>
-
-    <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
-        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-        computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
-        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-        public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
-
-    <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-        parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
-        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
-
-    <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;
-        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
-        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>
-
-    <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
-        for making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
-        form of a work.</p>
-
-    <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
-        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-        is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
-
-    <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
-        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-        implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
-        &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
-        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
-
-    <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
-        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-        control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
-        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-        which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
-        includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-        subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
-
-    <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-        Source.</p>
-
-    <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-        same work.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>
-
-    <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-        conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-        permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
-        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-        content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
-        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
-
-    <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-        in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-        of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-        with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-        the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-        not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
-        for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-        and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-        your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
-
-    <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-        the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-        makes it unnecessary.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>
-
-    <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-        measures.</p>
-
-    <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-        circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-        is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-        the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-        modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-        users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-        technological measures.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>
-
-    <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-        keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-        recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
-
-    <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-        and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>
-
-    <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
-
-    <ul>
-        <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-            it, and giving a relevant date.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-            released under this License and any conditions added under section
-            7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-            &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
-            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-            regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
-            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-            work need not make them do so.
-        </li>
-    </ul>
-
-    <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-        works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-        and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-        in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-        &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-        used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-        beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
-        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-        parts of the aggregate.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>
-
-    <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-        of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-        in one of these ways:</p>
-
-    <ul>
-        <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-            customarily used for software interchange.
-        </li>
 
-        <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
-            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-            with subsection 6b.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-            further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
-            Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
-            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-            Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
-            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-        </li>
-
-        <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-            charge under subsection 6d.
-        </li>
-    </ul>
-
-    <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-        included in conveying the object code work.</p>
-
-    <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
-        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-        or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-        into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-        doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
-        product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
-        typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-        actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
-        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-        the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
-
-    <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
-        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-        and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-        a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
-        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-        code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-        modification has been made.</p>
-
-    <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-        specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-        part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-        User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-        fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-        Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-        by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
-        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-        modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-        been installed in ROM).</p>
-
-    <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-        requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
-        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-        adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-        protocols for communication across the network.</p>
-
-    <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-        source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-        unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>
-
-    <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
-        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-        that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
-        apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-        under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-        this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
-
-    <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-        it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-        removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
-        additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
-
-    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-        add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-        that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
-
-    <ul>
-        <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-        </li>
-
-        <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-        </li>
-
-        <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-        </li>
-
-        <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-            authors of the material; or
-        </li>
-
-        <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-        </li>
-
-        <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-            those licensors and authors.
-        </li>
-    </ul>
-
-    <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
-        restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
-        received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-        governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-        restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
-        a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-        License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-        of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-        not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
-
-    <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-        must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-        where to find the applicable terms.</p>
-
-    <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-        form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-        the above requirements apply either way.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>
-
-    <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-        provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-        paragraph of section 11).</p>
-
-    <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-        finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-        holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-        prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
-
-    <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-        violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-        received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-        copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-        your receipt of the notice.</p>
-
-    <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-        licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-        this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-        material under section 10.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>
-
-    <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-        run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
-        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-        modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
-        not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>
-
-    <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-        propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
-        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
-
-    <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
-        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-        organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
-        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
-
-    <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-        rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
-        not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-        any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-        sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>
-
-    <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
-        work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>
-
-    <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
-        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-        hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-        but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-        consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
-        purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
-        patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-        this License.</p>
-
-    <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-        patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-        make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-        propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
-
-    <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
-        agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-        sue for patent infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
-        party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-        patent against the party.</p>
-
-    <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-        and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-        available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-        patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-        license to downstream recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
-        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-        in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-        country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
-
-    <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-        covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-        receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-        you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-        work and works based on it.</p>
-
-    <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within
-        the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-        conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-        specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
-        work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-        to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-        the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-        conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-        contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-        or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
-
-    <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-        any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-        otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>
-
-    <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-        excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
-        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-        not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-        the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>
-
-    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-        combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
-        License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-        but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-        section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-        combination as such.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>
-
-    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-        the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
-        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-        address new problems or concerns.</p>
-
-    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
-        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-        Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
-        option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-        version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-        Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-        GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-        by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
-
-    <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-        versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-        public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-        to choose that version for the Program.</p>
-
-    <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
-        permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-        author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-        later version.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>
-
-    <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
-        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-        IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-        ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>
-
-    <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-        USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-        EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-        SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
-
-    <h4><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>
-
-    <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-        above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-        reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-        an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-        Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-        copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

+<h3 class="western"><a name="gpl"></a>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
+<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
+<p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+&lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
+<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
+this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
+<h3 class="western"><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>
+<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
+software and other kinds of works.</p>
+<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
+designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By
+contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
+your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
+sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
+our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by
+its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
+<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
+you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
+new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
+<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
+have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
+software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
+freedom of others.</p>
+<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
+freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
+receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
+terms so they know their rights.</p>
+<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
+steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
+License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
+it.</p>
+<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
+explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both
+users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
+marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed
+erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
+<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
+modified versions of the software inside them, although the
+manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
+aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
+individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
+Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
+practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in
+other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
+domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
+freedom of users.</p>
+<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
+patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and
+use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do,
+we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free
+program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the
+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program
+non-free.</p>
+<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.</p>
+<h3 class="western"><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>
+<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
+License.</p>
+<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
+kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
+<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
+this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees”
+and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
+<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
+the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
+making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified
+version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier
+work.</p>
+<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
+based on the Program.</p>
+<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that,
+without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
+computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
+public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
+<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables
+other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
+through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
+conveying.</p>
+<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal
+Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and
+prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
+copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
+for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
+that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
+view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
+commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
+meets this criterion.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>
+<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the
+work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any
+non-source form of a work.</p>
+<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
+official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the
+case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
+one that is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
+<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
+other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
+form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
+Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
+that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which
+an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
+“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential
+component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
+operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
+compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
+to run it.</p>
+<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form
+means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an
+executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
+including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not
+include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
+performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
+example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
+associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
+shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
+specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
+communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
+parts of the work.</p>
+<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
+regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
+Source.</p>
+<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
+same work.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>
+<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
+conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
+permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
+content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
+<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
+in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
+with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which
+you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the
+covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under
+your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making
+any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
+with you.</p>
+<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
+the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
+makes it unnecessary.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal
+Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>
+<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
+measures.</p>
+<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
+forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
+circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
+with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
+limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
+forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim
+Copies.</h4>
+<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
+code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
+give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
+<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
+convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified
+Source Versions.</h4>
+<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications
+to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
+conditions:</p>
+<ul>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a) The work must carry prominent
+	notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">b) The work must carry prominent
+	notices stating that it is released under this License and any
+	conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
+	requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">c) You must license the entire
+	work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into
+	possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with
+	any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
+	and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License
+	gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
+	does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received
+	it. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
+	display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
+	interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
+	Notices, your work need not make them do so. 
+	</p>
+</ul>
+<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
+independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the
+covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a
+larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
+medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its
+resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
+of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
+Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
+License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source
+Forms.</h4>
+<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
+License, in one of these ways:</p>
+<ul>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a) Convey the object code in, or
+	embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
+	medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
+	physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">b) Convey the object code in, or
+	embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
+	medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three
+	years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
+	support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the
+	object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all
+	the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
+	durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
+	for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
+	performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
+	Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">c) Convey individual copies of
+	the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the
+	Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
+	and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
+	such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">d) Convey the object code by
+	offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge),
+	and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same
+	way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
+	require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the
+	object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network
+	server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
+	(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
+	facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
+	object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
+	Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
+	obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
+	satisfy these requirements. 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
+	provided you inform other peers where the object code and
+	Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
+	public at no charge under subsection 6d. 
+	</p>
+</ul>
+<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
+excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not
+be included in conveying the object code work.</p>
+<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which
+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for
+personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
+sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a
+product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in
+favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
+user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that
+class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or
+of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or
+is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product
+regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
+industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
+significant mode of use of the product.</p>
+<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any
+methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
+required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
+in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
+Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
+interfered with solely because modification has been made.</p>
+<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
+or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs
+as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of
+the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for
+a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized),
+the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement
+does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
+to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
+work has been installed in ROM).</p>
+<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
+include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
+warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
+by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the
+modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of
+the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
+across the network.</p>
+<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
+provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
+publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
+public in source code form), and must require no special password or
+key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>
+<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms
+of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
+conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire
+Program shall be treated as though they were included in this
+License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If
+additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part
+may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire
+Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
+additional permissions.</p>
+<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
+it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
+<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
+you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
+holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
+terms:</p>
+<ul>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a) Disclaiming warranty or
+	limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16
+	of this License; or 
+	</p>
+	<li/>
+<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">b) Requiring preservation of
+	specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that
+	material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works

+	</p>
+</ul>
+<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
+restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as
+you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it
+is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
+restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
+not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
+<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,
+you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
+where to find the applicable terms.</p>
+<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
+the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
+the above requirements apply either way.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>
+<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
+provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
+paragraph of section 11).</p>
+<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
+copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
+reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
+<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
+your receipt of the notice.</p>
+<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
+the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
+under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
+permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
+for the same material under section 10.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required
+for Having Copies.</h4>
+<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
+run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
+modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
+not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing
+of Downstream Recipients.</h4>
+<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
+propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
+<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control
+of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
+subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
+of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to
+that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives
+whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had
+or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
+possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
+predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
+reasonable efforts.</p>
+<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
+rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
+litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
+alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
+selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
+of it.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>
+<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
+this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
+The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor
+version”.</p>
+<p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent
+claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
+acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
+manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
+contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
+infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
+contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control”
+includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
+with the requirements of this License.</p>
+<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
+royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
+claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
+modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
+<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
+express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce
+a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or
+covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a
+patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
+commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
+<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
+license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
+for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
+License, through a publicly available network server or other readily
+accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding
+Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the
+benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
+arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
+License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
+“Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for
+the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
+your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
+one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
+to believe are valid.</p>
+<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent
+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
+covered work and works based on it.</p>
+<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include
+within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
+specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
+in the business of distributing software, under which you make
+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
+conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
+the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
+discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
+covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or
+(b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
+compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into
+that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
+March 2007.</p>
+<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
+limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that
+may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of
+Others' Freedom.</h4>
+<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
+agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
+License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
+If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
+your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
+example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
+for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
+only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
+to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU
+Affero General Public License.</h4>
+<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
+single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
+this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
+License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will
+apply to the combination as such.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of
+this License.</h4>
+<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
+new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
+may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
+<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
+Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
+version or of any later version published by the Free Software
+Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
+by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
+<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
+you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
+<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
+permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
+later version.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of
+Warranty.</h4>
+<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
+APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
+WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
+LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
+A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
+CORRECTION.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of
+Liability.</h4>
+<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
+AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
+DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
+(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
+INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
+OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
+HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.</p>
+<h4 class="western"><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of
+Sections 15 and 16.</h4>
+<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
+copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
